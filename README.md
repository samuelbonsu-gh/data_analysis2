# Facebook Ads Campaign Marketing Analysis

## ðŸ“Š Overview

This project analyzes Facebook ad campaign data for Q4 2023 across the UK, Nigeria, and other African countries. It was developed as part of my internship project with **Digital Echoes**.

The goal was to evaluate the performance of campaigns using key performance indicators (KPIs) and compare outcomes to business benchmarks to identify opportunities for improvement.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Compare number of campaigns by country
- Analyze campaign activity status (active, completed, not delivering)
- Track monthly ad spending and leads generated
- Calculate Cost Per Result (CPR) by region
- Recommend improvements based on the results

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- Microsoft PowerPoint (for the report)
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning and KPI analysis)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- A total of **48 campaigns** were run in Q4 2023
- **United Kingdom** had the highest number of campaigns (62.5%) but a very high CPR ($193.76)
- **Nigeria** had a much lower CPR, closer to its $0.30 benchmark
- Other countries underperformed in leads generated and CPR
- Most campaigns in the UK were inactive, suggesting possible inefficiency

---

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations

- Shift more campaign efforts to **Nigeria** and other African countries where CPR is lower
- Shorten campaign duration to avoid excess spending
- Investigate why UK CPR is too high (possible targeting issues or poor ad performance)
- Reactivate or redesign inactive UK campaigns with better strategy
